This topic describes how to create Minio instances by developers.

## Create Minio Instance on Local Storage

![alt-text=""](./images/local-storage.png)

In this deployment, Minio will use a VM's local persistent disk for storage. Use the following command to create a Minio instance:

```sh
cf create-service minio standard minio-instance-1 -c minio.conf
```

The minio.conf file should look like this:

```
{
  "accesskey": "randomaccesskey",
  "secretkey": "randomsecretkey"
}

```
Custom accesskey and secretkey should be provided. AccessKey is similar to username and should be minimum of 5 characters. SecretKey is similar to password, it should be randomly generated and kept secure.

## Start Minio with Azure Blob Storage Backend

In this deployment, Minio will provide S3 API access for Azure Blob Storage.

Run the following command to create a Minio instance:

```sh
cf create-service minio standard minio-instance-1 -c minio.conf
```

The minio.conf file should look like this:

```
{
  "gateway": "azure",
  "accesskey": "azure-storage-account-name",
  "secretkey": "azure-storage-account-key"
}
```

Change `azure-storage-account-name` and `azure-storage-account-key` with the actual Azure Account name and key.

## Create Minio for Google Cloud Storage Backend

In this deployment, Minio will provide S3 API access for Google Cloud Storage.

```sh
cf create-service minio standard minio-instance-1 -c minio.conf
```

Generated the Minio conf with the [minio-cf](https://github.com/minio/minio-cf) command:

```sh
minio-cf --access-key randomaccesskey --secret-key randomsecretkey --gcs /path/to/credentials.json > minio.conf
```

Custom access-key and secret-key should be provided. AccessKey is similar to username and should be minimum of 5 characters. SecretKey is similar to password, it should be randomly generated and kept secure. Follow [these steps](https://docs.minio.io/docs/minio-gateway-for-gcs) to generate the credentials.json file.
